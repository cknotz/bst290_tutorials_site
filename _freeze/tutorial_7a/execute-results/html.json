But, obviously, sometimes we are interested in *relationships where the independent variable is binomial (has two distinct categories) and the dependent variable is numeric*. The gender wage gap (gender and income) is one example, but there are also many others.^[On the gender wage gap see e.g., Blau and Kahn (2000). Gender differences in pay. *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 14(4):75–99.]\n\nThis tutorial will show you how you study such relationships between binomial and numerical variables using `R`. More specifically, we will see if gender is related to religiosity: If women are more religious than men (or vice versa).\n\nAs in the previous tutorial, we will start right away with the real *ESS* dataset, but you will use the small practice dataset in the de-bugging exercises.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n*Hvis du ønsker å lese en norsk tekst __i tillegg__: \"Lær deg R\", Kapittel 5.3.2*\n\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n# Hypotheses\n\nNot long ago, women were more likely than men to have conservative social attitudes, to vote for conservative parties, and to be religious.^[Inglehart and Norris (2000). The developmental theory of the gender gap: Women’s and men’s voting behavior in global perspective. *International Political Science Review*, 21(4):441–463.] More recently, this seems to have changed, however. Women are now more likely to vote for left parties and hold leftist political attitudes.^[Iversen, T. and Rosenbluth, F. (2010). *Women, Work, & Politics: The Political Economy of Gender Inequality*. Yale University Press, New Haven and London.] Whether or not they have become less religious, however, is not clear.^[Voas, D., McAndrew, S., and Storm, I. (2013). Modernization and the gender gap in religiosity: Evidence from cross-national European surveys. *KZfSS Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie*, 65(1):259–283.] It is therefore worth checking if women are today still more religious than men. \n\nBased on our (extremely brief) review of the existing scientific literature on this topic, one hypothesis would be that:\n\n> *Women are more religious than men.*\n\nA second hypothesis would be that:\n\n> *Women are less religious than men.*\n\nThe corresponding null hypothesis is then:\n\n> *Women are equally religious as men are.*\n\n\\newpage\n# Setup & data preparation\n\n## Setup\nTo do this tutorial, you only need one package: the `tidyverse` for data management and visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## Data preparation\nAs mentioned, we will be working with data from the *ESS* --- as before, from round 7 (2014). And, also as previously, we will only use the data from Norway.\n\nWe will also work only with a few variables:\n\n* `essround`, `cntry`, and `idno`;\n* `gndr`, the respondent's gender;\n* `rlgdgr`, a variable measuring how religious each respondent feels;\n\n\\newpage\n### Importing the dataset\nImporting the dataset works just the same way as before: You import the dataset file (here called `ess7.sav`) into `R` using `haven::read_sav()` and save the dataset in your *Environment* as `ess7`:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 <- haven::read_dta(\"ess7.dta\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n### Conversion & trimming\nThen you convert the data to the familiar format with `labelled::unlabelled()`:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 <- labelled::unlabelled(ess7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally you trim the dataset to the relevant observations and variables and save the new trimmed dataset under the same name:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 %>% \n  filter(cntry==\"NO\") %>% \n  select(essround,cntry,idno,gndr,rlgdgr) -> ess7\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, you can also create a dictionary for the final dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndict <- labelled::generate_dictionary(ess7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## Initial EDA\n\nAs before, it is important to take a look at the main variables and how they are stored so that you know if you may have to do further data transformations.\n\nA good start is to use the `attributes()` function, starting here with the `gndr` variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nattributes(ess7$gndr)\n## $levels\n## [1] \"Male\"   \"Female\"\n## \n## $label\n## [1] \"Gender\"\n## \n## $class\n## [1] \"factor\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `gndr` variable is stored as a *factor*, which is good because gender is a categorical variable.\n\nJust to confirm, you can use the `table()` function to let `R` show you how many observations you have per category:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(ess7$gndr)\n## \n##   Male Female \n##    764    672\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\nNow that `gndr` is taken care off, you can repeat the exercise with the `rlgdgr` (\"How religious are you?\") variable, the *dependent* variable here:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nattributes(ess7$rlgdgr)\n## $levels\n##  [1] \"Not at all religious\" \"1\"                    \"2\"                   \n##  [4] \"3\"                    \"4\"                    \"5\"                   \n##  [7] \"6\"                    \"7\"                    \"8\"                   \n## [10] \"9\"                    \"Very religious\"      \n## \n## $label\n## [1] \"How religious are you\"\n## \n## $class\n## [1] \"factor\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable ranges from \"Not at all religious\" to \"Very religious\" on a scale from 0 to 10. Before proceeding, it makes sense to see how many observations you have per category:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(ess7$rlgdgr)\n## \n## Not at all religious                    1                    2 \n##                  288                  128                  147 \n##                    3                    4                    5 \n##                  160                  116                  221 \n##                    6                    7                    8 \n##                  131                  104                   79 \n##                    9       Very religious \n##                   23                   34\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, the \"missing\" categories are empty! \n\nBecause the variable ranges from 0 to 10, you can treat it as a *numeric* variable. **But:** The output above tells you that the variable is stored as a *factor*, like the `gndr` variable. If you want to use in calculations or statistical tests, you first need to convert it to numeric --- and here the problem is that the labels and underlying numerical values do not exactly correspond (you may recall the problem from Tutorial 3).\n\n\\newpage\nYou can see this if you quickly use the `visfactor()` function from `bst290` (loading the package is not needed):\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbst290::visfactor(variable = \"rlgdgr\", dataset = ess7)\n##  values               labels\n##       1 Not at all religious\n##       2                    1\n##       3                    2\n##       4                    3\n##       5                    4\n##       6                    5\n##       7                    6\n##       8                    7\n##       9                    8\n##      10                    9\n##      11       Very religious\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you might also remember how you can fix this: Convert to numeric with `as.numeric()`, but subtract 1 to account for the label-value divergence:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7$relig_num <- as.numeric(ess7$rlgdgr) - 1\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is also a good chance to save the new numeric version with a decent name --- who wants to twist their fingers into a knot every time they type a variable name?!\n\n\\newpage\n# Visual analysis\n\nNow that you have both your variables ready to go, you can do a first visual inspection to see if there are interesting patterns in the data. \n\nThe hypotheses predict gender differences in religiosity, so it would make most sense to calculate the average level of religiosity for both men and women and see if they differ. That difference can then be shown graphically.\n\n## Option 1: Bar graph\nYou might remember (from Tutorials 3 and 4) how you can calculate summary statistics of one variable over the categories of another --- and then directly visualize the result in a bar graph: with `group_by()` and `summarize()`, plus the pipe (`%>%`) to link all steps together!\n\nFirst, the calculation:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 %>% \n  group_by(gndr) %>% \n  summarize(avgrel = mean(relig_num, na.rm = T))\n## # A tibble: 2 × 2\n##   gndr   avgrel\n##   <fct>   <dbl>\n## 1 Male     3.16\n## 2 Female   4.11\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that women (in Norway) are indeed more religious, on average, than men.\n\n\\newpage\nAs you know, you can then feed the result directly into a `ggplot2` bar graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 %>% \n  group_by(gndr) %>% \n  summarize(avgrel = mean(relig_num, na.rm = T)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gndr, y = avgrel)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"''How religious are you?''\") +\n    theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tutorial_7a_files/figure-html/plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between men and women when it comes to their religiosity is directly apparent. Also interesting: Despite the between-gender differences, the two means are both relatively low (3 and 4 on a 0-10 scale). Overall, Norwegians are tending toward not being very religious.\n\n\\newpage\n## Option 2: Boxplot\n\nWhile a bar graph is a good way to represent group differences, you can also use a boxplot (as also shown by Kellstedt and Whitten 2018, 175). As you know from the previous tutorial on Data Visualization, you can create a bivariate boxplot like this:\n\n* You specify the grouping variable (`gndr`) as the variable that goes on the x-axis, and...\n* ...the outcome variable (`relig_num`) as the variable for the y-axis;\n* Then you just add a `geom_boxplot()` geometric object layer to draw the boxplots;\n\nThe code and result looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(y = relig_num, x = gndr)) +\n    geom_boxplot()\n## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n## (`stat_boxplot()`).\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tutorial_7a_files/figure-html/hist-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the two groups is quite easy to see.\n\n\\newpage\nIf you like, you can then also polish the graph a bit more:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ness7 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(y = relig_num, x = gndr)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"''How religious are you?''\") +\n    theme_bw()\n## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n## (`stat_boxplot()`).\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tutorial_7a_files/figure-html/histpol-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n# Statistical test\n\nWe have found that the men and women in our sample differ in their average levels of religiosity, with women being on average more religious than men. But: *Is this difference also statistically significant?* In other words, does the difference we found in the *ESS* data really reflect a true difference in the general Norwegian population, or is it simply a result of *sampling variation* (the random variation in the data that result from the fact that we are only working with a *sample* of the entire population)?\n\nWe can find out with a formal statistical test. In this case, since our *independent* variable (gender) is binomial (categorical, with two distinct categories) and the *dependent* variable is numeric (religiosity), the appropriate test is the difference-of-means *t*-test (see also Kellstedt and Whitten 2018, Chapter 8.4.2).\n\n## The `t.test()` function\n\nYou already know the `t.test()` function from the tutorial on confidence intervals --- and this is obviously also the function to use here.\n\nTo run a *t*-test with the `t.test()` function, you just have to enter your dependent and independent variables separated by a `~` (tilde) plus the dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(relig_num ~ gndr, \n       data = ess7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important part is the *formula*-part: `relig_num ~ gndr`. Here, we specify that we want to know if religiosity (`relig_num`) differs significantly between the genders (`gndr`). *This is the part that you need to get right when you use this test!* Generally: `outcome ~ group` (see also the help file under `?t.test()`).\n\n\\newpage\n## Interpretation\n\nLet's look at the result: \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(relig_num ~ gndr, \n       data = ess7)\n## \n## \tWelch Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  relig_num by gndr\n## t = -6.5321, df = 1372.3, p-value = 9.11e-11\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -1.2378751 -0.6660886\n## sample estimates:\n##   mean in group Male mean in group Female \n##             3.162943             4.114925\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always in `R`, the output is not very polished but it just takes a bit of practice to read this:\n\n* Start at the bottom, where it says `sample estimates`: This reports the simple group averages in the dependent variable --- and you already know these numbers: The average of `relig_num` for men is around 3.16, while the average for women is around 4.11 (see also Section 4 above).\n* Under `alternative hypothesis`, `R` tells you what you are testing here: Is there a significant difference between the group averages for men and women?\n* Now to the 'meat part', right under `data`: \n  + You get the *t*-statistic: -6.532. In this case, this number reflects the ratio of the mean differences and their standard error --- or the 'signal-to-noise' ratio (see Kellstedt and Whitten 2018, 176). \n  + `df` are the degrees of freedom.\n  + `p-value` is, obviously, the *p*-value. `R` gives you this number in the scientific notation. It corresponds to 0.00000000009109578 or a 0 followed by 10 more 0s and then 9.1... --- a *very small number*. \n  \n`R` has a little helper function called `format.pval()` that can be useful when you need to decipher a cryptic *p*-value shown in scientific notation. To use it, you just paste the *p*-value you get from `t.test()` (or any other test that returns a *p*-value) into `format.pval()`. It is also useful to specify the number of significant (non-zero) numbers after the comma you want shown and the level of precision you want. Here, we want up to three numbers after the comma (with `digits=3`) and that any *p*-value that is smaller than 0.01 should just be shown as *< 0.01* (with `eps=0.01`): \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nformat.pval(9.11e-11, digits = 3, eps = 0.01)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"<0.01\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAs above, the *p*-value we got is *very* small -- smaller than 0.01 in any case.\n\nNow to the interesting part: What does all of this mean? *Try to interpret the results based on the explanation in Kellstedt/Whitten (2018, Chapter 8)!*  \n  \n<!-- **Focus on the following two things** when you interpret the result from a *t*-test: -->\n\n<!-- The first thing you would look at is the *p*-value, which tells you if the difference between the two groups is *statistically* significant --- if you can conclude that there probably is also a difference in the wider population and therefore reject the null hypothesis.  -->\n\n<!-- As explained in Kellstedt & Whitten (2018, Chapter 8.3), the *lower* the *p*-value, the *more confident* we can be that there is a meaningful difference in the wider population. Usually, we want *p* to be lower than 0.05 (which corresponds to the 5% level of significance). In our case, *p* is very clearly smaller than 0.05. We can therefore reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there likely is a difference in the wider population between men and women when it comes to their religiosity. -->\n\n<!-- But it is important not to forget the *substantive* difference! In other words, how big is the gap between men and women in absolute terms? For this, we look at the `sample estimates` where `R` tells us that men have an average score of around 3.16 and women one of around 4.11. This means, in substantive terms, that men and women differ by around one point on the entire 0-10 scale. Surely, this is a difference, and the visual analysis above also showed it --- but is it really large enough to be meaningful? I leave that decision up to you. -->\n\n<!-- An important point when you interpret difference-of-means *t*tests: A difference (or effect in general) may be *statistically* significant, but this does not mean that it is also *substantively* important. If we have a very large dataset with many, many observations, we will usually get low *p*-values (see Kellstedt & Whitten 2018, 164). In such a large dataset, even tiny differences between two groups will then show up as statistically significant --- even if they are really not much to talk about.  -->\n<!-- Therefore: Always consider both the *substantive* and the *statistical* significance of your results. -->\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMany important political and social questions are about differences between groups: Do men earn more than women? Are workers more in favor of left parties than \"capitalists\"? Do immigrants experience more discrimination than the native-born? \n\nYou now know how you can answer this type of question using survey data and `R`, specifically using the difference-of-means *t*-test.\n\nYou can find de-bugging exercises in the usual spot. There, you will test if men and women differ in their body heights.\n\n\n\n<!-- # Exercises -->\n\n<!-- ## Exercise 1: Immigrants and religious practices -->\n\n<!-- In this exercise, you stay within the broader area of attitudes toward religion, but you will now look at how people perceive the impact of immigrants on their country's religious practices and whether these perceptions differ between genders. The variable you will work with is called `rlgueim` and should already be in your dataset. -->\n\n<!-- **Assumption: You have gone through the entire tutorial, step by step and without errors, until here.** -->\n\n<!-- 1. Get familiar with the `rlgueim` variable using the familiar functions in `R` and the ESS Data Portal: How does the variable look like, how is it stored within `R`? Do you need to apply any data transformations before you can use it as the dependent variable in a *t*-test? If yes, prepare the variable for the analysis. -->\n<!-- 2. Run a *t*-test to see if men and women differ significantly from each other on this variable. -->\n<!-- 3. Interpret the test result. -->\n\n<!-- ## De-bugging exercise -->\n\n\n\\newpage\n# (Voluntary) \"Welch test?!\"\n\nYou may have noticed that the test result also says \"**Welch** Two Sample t-test\", and you may wonder where the \"Welch\" comes from.\n\nTo explain: The *t*-test procedure explained in Kellstedt and Whitten makes a particular assumption about the underlying data. Specifically, it assumes that the two groups you compare have equal variances --- that the data are about equally 'noisy' in each group. \n\nThis assumption is obviously not always justified, however --- and the \"Welch's\" test procedure does not make this assumption. `R` runs by default the more flexible Welch test, just to be safe. \n\nDespite the difference in assumptions, both tests are interpreted the same way and should (usually) produce about the same results.\n\nYou can tell `R` to use the Kellstedt and Whitten procedure if you set the `var.equal` option to `TRUE` (if you state explicitly that you are willing to assume that both groups have equal variances):\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(relig_num ~ gndr,\n       data = ess7,\n       var.equal = TRUE)\n## \n## \tTwo Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  relig_num by gndr\n## t = -6.5639, df = 1429, p-value = 7.314e-11\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -1.2364828 -0.6674809\n## sample estimates:\n##   mean in group Male mean in group Female \n##             3.162943             4.114925\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow compare this result to the one from before:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(relig_num ~ gndr, \n       data = ess7)\n## \n## \tWelch Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  relig_num by gndr\n## t = -6.5321, df = 1372.3, p-value = 9.11e-11\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -1.2378751 -0.6660886\n## sample estimates:\n##   mean in group Male mean in group Female \n##             3.162943             4.114925\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are basically the same as above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
