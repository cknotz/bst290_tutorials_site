This website features all `R` tutorials for the BST290 *Kvantitativ forskningsmetode* course. Simply use the menu on the side to navigate to and between the different tutorials and use the search field (top right) to find tutorials with specific contents.

::: {.callout-important}

To make reading the tutorials easier and quicker, **download them as PDFs and print them out**. There are download buttons at the beginning of each tutorial (under the table of contents on the right side). You *can* of course read all the material "on screen" if you really want to, but that is not recommended. Ideally, you read each of the tutorials first on paper and you use this website mainly to quickly look things up later.

Some students wrote their own short tutorials on other relevant topics (promot engineering with *ChatGPT* and additional data visualization tricks) and are sharing them with you here. You can find these if you **scroll down in the navigation menu on the left** 👈.
